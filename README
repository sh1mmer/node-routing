A very simple routing library for Node.

-=Step 1.=-

Install routing.js in your Node path (e.g. ~/.node_libraries)

-=Step 2.=-

Require routing

routing = require("routing");

-=Step 3.=-

Add routes

routes.map(directory, urlPath);

If the urlPath is found in a URL then routing will try serve any files found from directory based on the remaining url.

.js files will be run and routing will not "serve" them, they must serve themselves

.html files will be served as text/html

All other files will be served as text/plain

-=Step 4.=-

In an HTTP server pass the request (req) and response (res) to route

routing.route(req, res);
